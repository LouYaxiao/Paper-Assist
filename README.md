# Paper-Assist
Simple python code for reading papers
I want to build a paper assistant for my Python class, and I want it to have at least four parts of functions: 1. I want my users to use a few papers to train a little assistant who is more suitable for their subject characteristics; 2. They can use the translation plug-in to read faster based on their mother language; 3. They can use LLMs to reach these goals: Word frequency statistics, A variety of distributed optimization tools, Open-source corpus training sets, and model parameters. 4. Automatically generate the related documents' mind map, framework, and key points.
